<h1 align="center">Free Time Projects✨</h1>

This is a small collection of **Fun projects**, **Exercises**, and **Codes** that I did in my *free time* or while doing other projects when I encountered problems and tried to solve them.


 > Note: This collection is only `C++` projects . ![h](https://img.shields.io/badge/only-cpp-green)

## Description 📑

Some codes contain their full descriptions in a document file such as a `.pdf` next to them, and only files that do not have a document file next to them are included in this section.📍

* V_L_P/base10to2.cpp ⇒ Convert base 10 numbers to binary .
